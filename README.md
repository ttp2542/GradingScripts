# GradingScripts
Welcome to the GradingScripts, home of all the scripts needed to grade the GCIS course sequence!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a brief guide for how to use the grading scripts for the GCIS course sequence. In this quick guide, I’ll be going over how to use these scripts, each of there purposes, and how to use them for the first time. If you’re not a CA for GCIS, please stop reading. Or don’t. Not like this will be a very entertaining read.
